# UltraNoise

## What is Ultra Noise 

UltraNoise is a Node base Noise processing tool for the Unity editor. Unlike other noise tools 
where the noise output is stored in a texture, UltraNoise contains all the logic within and allows you to sample any coordinate in any dimension.

UltraNoise also allows you to have multiple pathways deriving from the original source and can be used separately.

## Who and What?

Ultra noise is a tool that has been in the works for quite some time and has manifested many times, but now we believe it has reached its final Form. Since our work has been based on the work of others we decide to make the tool opens source and share it with the community.

This project is a side project… But I hope that we'll be able to continue to ship new features and support it to the best of our abilities.

With respects

## Under the Hood

WARNING!!
The tool uses Odin Inspector… A Lot. 
Until now our main goal was to provide a tool that works and is optimized and we did not want to waste time fighting with the unity editor.
So for the time being in order to use the tool you would have to get the Odin Inspector.
We have considered removing it but that's not in the plans yet.


UltraNoise’s power also surges from the following awesome free frameworks and Plugins:

* [xNode](https://github.com/Siccity/xNode)
* [Procedural Noise](https://github.com/Scrawk/Procedural-Noise/)
* [OdinInspector](https://odininspector.com/)
